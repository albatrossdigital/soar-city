Often these hoses, with nozzles attached, can be found in a collapsed condition. It appears that in these cases, the rubber-like or plastic-tasting water that had been in the hose could, under the right conditions, be pulled back into homes by partial vacuum pressure. Additionally some customers can detect a slight taste and odor difference in times of drought when water is processed from the Susquehanna. This does not impact the overall quality of the water.","Bureau of Water and Wastewater","http://publicworks.baltimorecity.gov/Bureaus/WaterWastewater.aspx",,,,,"Trash, Recycling, Water, Environment","Water, Wastewater, Sewage, Trash Collection, Recycling","Public Works",,,,,,,

Large trees provide many benefits to the citizens of Baltimore. Some examples of these benefits are absorbing storm water, cleaning the air of pollutants, shading the streets, providing a buffer to cars, increasing real estate values and lowering utility bills. There are many new approaches to incorporating large trees with pedestrian walkways and they still provide a safe experience.",,,,,,,"Trash, Recycling, Water, Environment","Tree Planting, Pruning, Tree Removal","General Services",,,,,,,

"What is the homestead tax credit?","The homestead tax credit program was designed to limit the amount of the annual increase in taxable assessments for eligible owner occupied properties. The program dates back to the late 1970’s, a period of rapid escalation in property values. State law requires each Maryland local government to establish a limit on how much owner occupied residential taxable assessments may increase each year. The program protects homeowners from increases in taxable assessment above the level established by local law, or 10%, if no local action is taken. In the early 1990’s, the City established the annual cap at 4% and it continues to be set at 4% today. The credit is applied against the taxes due on the portion of the reassessment exceeding the 4% homestead cap. The credit is applied directly to the property owner’s tax bill.","Baltimore City Tax Credits","http://finance.baltimorecity.gov/PublicInformation/TaxCredits.aspx","Tax Credit Application","https://cityservices.baltimorecity.gov/PropertyTaxCredits/Account/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fPropertyTaxCredits",,,"Property, Buildings, Housing, Development","Utilities, Housing, Property Tax, Buy City-Owned Property, Donate Property","Finance",,,,,,,
