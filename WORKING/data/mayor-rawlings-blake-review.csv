"A Safer City","<p>I am very concerned about the recent incidents of violence in Baltimore City. As of this week, we have had 9 young people under the age of 20 killed this year. Last year, we had only 4 youth homicides. This serves as a reminder that while we have made solid progress recently in our fight against crime, there is still much more work to do.</p><p> On Wednesday, at the request of my administration, the Board of Estimates took some very concrete steps to keep moving our city forward in the crime fight. More than $2 million was approved to strengthen our police enforcement zones, support Operation Ceasefire, and develop a new youth connection center by this summer.</p><p> During my State of the City address, I was very clear about my vision and passion to make Baltimore City a safer place to live. This package of initiatives passed by the BOE represents a down payment on the commitments I made to do everything within my power to reduce crime in Baltimore City.</p><p> Additionally, I have decided to add one more stop on my Public Safety Forum tour—this time focused specifically on youth violence. I want to speak with Baltimore’s kids and young adults, to engage directly with them, hear their concerns regarding crime in Baltimore, and listen to their ideas for resolution. This city-wide forum will take place at City Hall on May 13, 6:00 pm.</p><p> We will continue working with Baltimore’s residents on this issue and other matters of public safety at the next two stops on our Public Safety Forum tour: the Northwestern and Southwestern police districts (details listed below). I hope you will join us and spread the word. Reducing homicide and violent crime is my top priority. My administration will continue to pursue all options when it comes to making Baltimore a safer city.</p>","4/25/2014","Safer Streets, Innovative Government, Rawlings-Blake Review","Safer Streets, Innovative Government","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Better Every Day","<p>This past Sunday, I joined members of Baltimore’s faith community for an annual tradition, the Blessing of the City. It is good to know that communities of faith are praying for our city’s success, safety, and good health. I am grateful for every prayer, every good thought, and every positive effort to uplift our city. We all know Baltimore City still has many challenges, but we also have a lot to be grateful for. Our city is a great place to live, and a great place to raise a family—and it’s getting better every day.</p><p> Blight is being eliminated from many of our neighborhoods, and my Vacants to Value program is hard at work. This week, we celebrated the opening of one of the initiative’s great successes: Fells Point Station. Built in 1860, the building once served as the Eastern Station House in one of Baltimore’s first police districts. It was later used as a Boys and Girls Club, but was eventually left to stand vacant for nearly two decades. Fells Point Station incorporates the rehabilitation of this historic building and the construction of a 39,000 square foot addition to create a 65,000 square foot, 4-story mixed-use building in Upper Fells Point. The building now provides 47 mixed-income residential units and approximately 3,000 square feet of retail space on Broadway.</p><p> I am very proud of the work that has been accomplished through Vacants to Value. Since its launch in November 2010, the program has spurred more than $85 million in private investment in communities all across Baltimore City. City wide, Baltimore Housing has demolished more than 800 vacant and blighted properties, and more than 1,200 properties are being rehabbed. We have sold more than 1,000 vacant, city-owned properties. We have issued more than 1,500 citations to vacant property owners. The program has also provided thousands of dollars in homeownership incentives, with more than 30 percent of those incentives going to purchasers who are new to Baltimore City.</p><p> City government is more transparent and connected than ever before. This week, I announced a key reform that will bring the financial disclosure process online, making it easier for residents to view their elected officials’ financial disclosures. This new system will replace our current, antiquated process, which requires government officials to submit hard copy forms to the ethics board and requires residents to visit City Hall in person if they wish to view these documents.</p><p> This reform is just one of a number of major advances my administration has made for government transparency. It puts Baltimore ahead of the game across the State of Maryland, and it gives residents valuable resources to help them stay informed about city government.</p><p> And we have seen a decrease in homicides and violence. These promising results are the effect of a persistent focus on violent repeat offenders and on strengthening partnerships between Baltimore Police and the residents of our communities. As part of our efforts to strengthen these partnerships, I have been hosting a series of Public Safety Forums to let residents know how hard we are working to make the city safer, to present our strategy, and to discuss feedback from residents.</p><p> The next stop on our Public Safety Forum tour will take place tonight at 7:00 pm in the Southern District. Please join us at the National Federation of the Blind, 200 E. Wells Street, to discuss how we can work together to make Baltimore’s communities safer.</p>","4/17/2014","Stronger Neighborhoods, Innovative Government, Safer Streets, Rawlings-Blake Review","Stronger Neighborhoods, Innovative Government, Safer Streets","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Communities in Motion","<p>Schools are a key ingredient for a thriving economy, helping to lift many of our residents out of poverty. And they are anchors for communities that are working to grow for generations to come.</p><p> In Baltimore we have accomplished something most other cities in America can only dream of. We’ve secured a BILLION dollar investment for rebuilding and modernizing schools all across our city through the 21st Century School Buildings Plan. But when the history is written about this transformative period of change for education in Baltimore City, it will be noted that the Waverly community was a trailblazer!</p><p> This week, I attended the ribbon cutting for the new Waverly Elementary/Middle School—one of the first completely new schools built in our city in decades. The Waverly community has been fighting for years to make this school a reality. Residents and community leaders in Waverly came together and demanded better for their children, and I cannot commend them enough for all their hard work.</p><p> Baltimore needs this determination and grit—residents who are bold, honest, and courageous in their efforts to keep this city that we love moving forward. In our efforts to grow Baltimore by 10,000 families, we are focused on making our city an attractive destination for new residents and a better place to live for those who have called our city home for decades.</p><p> I am constantly gratified to see residents who are passionate about their communities and are taking action—residents like those who attended last night’s Eastern District Public Safety Forum at the American Brewery Building. There was a strong turnout at the event, and I want to thank everyone who attended. Each of these citizens demonstrated interest and a motivation to make our Baltimore communities safer.</p><p> Last year, Baltimore saw a 300% increase in residents calling in to report tips to the police. That is amazing! Citizen participation is critical to the success of our fight against crime. Public safety is about more than just law enforcement. It is about communities in motion, moving together toward a brighter future.</p>","4/11/2014","Better Schools, Stronger Neighborhoods, Safer Streets, Rawlings-Blake Review","Better Schools, Stronger Neighborhoods, Safer Streets","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Growing Baltimore","<p>Baltimore is the city that I love, and I have worked my entire life to make it better. While our city has struggled with violent crime, and our homicide rate remains stubbornly high, we are making great strides toward being a safer city.</p><p> This past March was the safest month that Baltimore has had since 1983, and the number of homicides was in the single digits. This significant drop in homicides coincided with the Baltimore Police Department’s expansion of enforcement zones—from 4 zones to 17. We remain focused on our fight to reduce crime, and we are working in every neighborhood in Baltimore to build partnerships with communities and create a safer Baltimore.</p><p> Public safety is my administration’s top priority, and we are not going to let up until every community in our city feels safe. We will continue to invest the resources necessary to protect our residents and continue modernizing our police force.</p><p> As part of our efforts to strengthen partnerships with Baltimore’s communities, I am hosting a series of Public Safety Forums—to let residents know how hard we are working to make the city safer, to present our strategy, and to hear citizens’ feedback on how we can build better relationships between police and residents. This month we will be speaking with residents in the Eastern and Southern police districts.</p><p> I want to express my firm conviction that Baltimore is a great place to live, and a great place to raise a family. Just consider all that we have going for us! Earlier this week I announced just one of Baltimore’s many summer festivals, the 2014 African American Festival, which will take place June 21 – 22. The African American Festival introduces new & exciting ways to honor our past, celebrate our accomplishments, and showcase our future.</p><p> This year’s festival will include musical performances from R&B Divas star Monifa, the multi-talented Jacob Latimore, Chico DeBarge, and the rock-based funk band Mint Condition on Saturday, followed by gospel performances from The Choir Boyz, and Preachers of L.A. star Deitrick Haddon on Sunday. Soulful R&B crooner Johnny Gill, and Grammy Award-winning artist Brandy will take the main stage on Sunday evening to close out the festival. For a complete list of performers, or for more info, visit www.africanamericanfestival.net.</p><p> One of my goals as mayor of Baltimore is to grow our city by 10,000 families. I want everyone to be able to have a piece of the amazing Baltimore that I know.</p>","4/4/2014","Safer Streets, Stronger Neighborhoods, Rawlings-Blake Review","Safer Streets, Stronger Neighborhoods","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Cultivating Young Leaders","<p>Today I was joined by author and educator Stedman Graham, as well as representatives from Kaiser Permanente to announce our intention to bring a new youth-focused program to Baltimore City. Mr. Graham has taken the program, known as Identity Leadership Training, to communities all across the country, and it has shown tremendous results in teaching life lessons to help our young people succeed.</p><p> I want to emphasize that our investment in Identity Leadership Training will be another initiative in a long line of efforts that my administration has made to empower our young people. Whether it was in fighting for and winning $1 billion in school construction funds, or through the countless hours that I personally spend each year visiting classrooms to promote reading skills and school attendance, my goal has always been to provide the very best resources to support our youth and to let them know how much we care about and love them.</p><p> So when the opportunity came to work with Mr. Graham and Kaiser Permanente to bring this program to Baltimore, I jumped at the chance. Kaiser has stepped up to the plate to provide $25,000 in funding, and we are actively working to identify additional partners to assist us in these efforts. We will continue our outreach to the Baltimore City School system to work in a coordinated fashion to ensure these resources reach those youth who are most in need. There are still a few details to finalize but we anticipate having the program up and running in Baltimore this coming fall.</p><p> Identity Leadership Training will be a great addition to existing programs like our recently announced B’More Night Hoops. This competitive basketball league will provide young people with quality recreation and constructive activities to help keep them on the right path. In addition to the physical exercise they receive, players will attend life skills and education seminars each week, prior to the start of the week’s first game. Registration for the league closes today, but there is still time for teams ages 15 – 17 and 18 – 21 to get in on the action if they hurry!</p><p> We have a great opportunity to do something positive for our youth, and I’m honored to be joining Mr. Graham and Kaiser Permanente. Baltimore’s rising generation has great potential, and I am committed to making investments that support their success.</p>","3/28/2014","Stronger Neighborhoods, Cleaner and Healthier City, Rawlings-Blake Review","Stronger Neighborhoods, Cleaner and Healthier City","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Stronger Communities","<p>Spring has finally arrived, and I know I’m not the only one who is ready to put the snow and cold behind us! After a long winter, many Baltimoreans are ready to get out their brooms and start sweeping out the cobwebs. But it’s not just our eaves and cellars that need to be swept out. Earlier this week, I was pleased to announce that, starting next month, the Department of Public Works is going to help “Clean Up Baltimore” by extending mechanical street sweeping to every City neighborhood.</p><p> For years, mechanical street sweeping has helped clean the streets of Downtown and central Baltimore, as well as many of our major commuter routes and a few of our neighborhoods. But currently, just 30% of city streets are swept on a regular basis. The Citywide Mechanical Street Sweeping Program will ensure that more than 90% of city streets are swept at least once a month.</p><p> Not only do clean streets make for more lively neighborhoods, they also mean cleaner waterways. Left alone, large pieces of debris can lead to clogged storm drains and flooded streets. Dangerous chemicals and germs left behind by things like automobile debris, animal waste, and yard treatments drain into our streams and into the bay. The tons of trash collected by street sweepers are properly disposed of, instead of ending up in our storm water system.</p><p> Cleaner communities are more livable communities. A big focus of my administration has been investing in communities, and looking for ways that we can work with residents to make Baltimore a stronger, more appealing city.</p><p> This commitment is reflected in the budget that I presented to the Board of Estimates on Wednesday.</p><p> My proposed FY15 budget shows how far Baltimore has come in recent years. In addition to expanding our street sweeping program, the budget includes no cuts to City services and no tax increases. There are not many other cities in America who can say they managed to cut property taxes, invest in education, and eliminate blight from communities while simultaneously reducing their structural deficit by more than half.</p><p> It is a strong budget, and it clearly demonstrates that Baltimore City is committed to our residents’ quality of life.</p><p> I have lived in Baltimore my entire life, and I love this city. I want nothing more than to see Baltimore’s communities grow and thrive. I am committed to moving our city forward and in these efforts, I am truly grateful for the partnership of Baltimore’s dedicated and passionate communities.</p>","3/21/2014","Cleaner and Healthier City, Innovative Government, Rawlings-Blake Review","Cleaner and Healthier City, Innovative Government","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Safer Streets","<p>Public safety is an issue that is on the minds of citizens, businesses, communities, City officials—and it is on my mind every hour of every day.</p><p> While we have made major gains in our efforts to make Baltimore a safer city (statistics show that crime has decreased in a number major categories, including assault, robbery, rape, and even overall violent crime), we need to do better. Our citizens deserve better.</p><p> The cornerstone of our crime fighting strategy is focusing on targeting violent repeat offenders. We are working to make our police force more nimble and technologically savvy so that we can be proactive and remove these criminals from the streets before they commit violent crimes.</p><p> To enhance our focus on violent repeat offenders, we are implementing a program that has seen success in several other cities: Operation Ceasefire. This program has shown great promise in reducing homicides in several other big cities. Over the past several weeks, my administration has been working to get the program up and running here in Baltimore. It will be a collaborative effort across several City agencies, as well as law enforcement partners at all levels of government. Operation Ceasefire will continue our all-hands-on-deck approach to fighting crime, and I am convinced that it will complement our efforts to make our city safer.</p><p> The program will focus on violent repeat offenders and will work directly with community members and law enforcement agencies to make clear that the violence taking place in our communities must end now; that there will be severe and swift consequences for any future acts of violence; and that if you are genuinely sincere about wanting to change your life, we are here with the resources and support to assist you in that endeavor.</p><p> It is important that we continue to work to strengthen the partnership between the police and our communities. Last year we saw a 300% increase in residents calling in to report tips to the police. We need to continue working together to reduce violence in our communities. I would like to urge all of Baltimore’s residents to engage, speak up, and work with us to reduce violence.</p><p> To that end, my administration has also increased support for Crime Stoppers, a central tip line for residents to provide information that could help to solve a crime or prevent one from taking place. If you or someone you know has any information that could help, please call Crime Stoppers at 866-7-LOCKUP.</p><p> This past Wednesday, I joined with Police Commissioner Batts, leaders from the Western police district, and members of the community at Frederick Douglass High School to hold the first in a series of Public Safety Forums. In the coming weeks, we will be visiting with residents in each of the nine police districts to explain our public safety strategy, to discuss crime reduction, and to afford residents the opportunity to meet with me, the police commissioner, and other members of the administration to inquire about current initiatives and ways they can volunteer to help.</p><p> We are taking every step imaginable to reduce violent crime and homicides in our city. I have charged Police Commissioner Batts with a broad range of reforms that will ultimately make our police force more nimble and responsive in the crime fight, while building bridges with the communities we serve. I urge you to join us for our upcoming Public Safety Forums.

"Inspired to Inspire","<p>The contributions that women have made to society have had—and continue to have—a strong impact on the lives of men, women, and children everywhere. I am honored to celebrate Women’s History Month during March, and to raise a testament to the contributions of women in our nation’s history and in the history of Baltimore City. I am honored because, each and every day, I see the dedication to family, community, and the next generation that these women display. And for this I am inspired to inspire.</p><p> Throughout the month, I will honor, applaud, and recognize the inspirational women in Baltimore City—past, present, and future—with programming under the banner of Inspired to Inspire: A Sisterhood of Women.</p><p> Earlier this week, I announced the Inspired to Inspire: A Sisterhood of Women city-wide contest. From now until March 19, anyone can nominate the woman who is most inspirational to them. Nominees must be 18 years or older and a resident of Baltimore City.</p><p> On the last day of March, I will announce seven of the inspirational women as winners. I will recognize these winners on FOX45, one of the contest sponsors. Winners will also be given a special reception at Fleet Street Kitchen, another contest sponsor. For details on the contest, visit www.baltimorecity.gov/inspired.</p><p> In addition to the contest, my Inspired to Inspire: A Sisterhood of Women campaign consists of inspirational events and activities throughout Women’s History Month. Every Monday and Wednesday, I will share a new Inspired to Inspire video with followers on Facebook and Twitter. This week’s videos included a conversation I had with my mom, Dr. Nina Rawlings, as she shared words of wisdom. I am blessed to call her ‘Mom.’</p><p> Leslie King-Hammond, founding director of the Center for Race & Culture at MICA, and Dr. Marietta English, president of the Baltimore Teachers Union, rounded out this week’s videos. Have a look and I think you’ll see why I think these are two truly inspirational women. And don’t forget to follow along at twitter.com/mayorsrb and facebook.com/Stephanie.RawlingsBlake for a new video twice a week in March.</p><p> We are just one week into March, and I feel incredibly grateful for the inspirational and inspiring women of Baltimore. I am looking forward to the rest of this month’s messages, and I hope you will join me in the spirit of Inspired to Inspire: A Sisterhood of Women.</p>","3/7/2014","Stronger Neighborhoods, Rawlings-Blake Review","Stronger Neighborhoods","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Building on Their Legacy","<p>Today is the last day of Black History Month. For 28 days, we have looked back on the history that has been made by people of color in our city and our nation. We have reverently remembered their struggles and enriched our own lives by expanding our understanding of how the past informs our present. This month, I have been truly inspired by not only our forebears, but also the promise of a rising generation that honors the legacy and culture that have come down to us through the years and continue to thrive.</p><p> This week I hosted students from Reginald F. Lewis High School of Business and Law and Frederick Douglass High School for a screening of Rise! The Road to Civil Rights (1940 – 1968), an episode of the PBS documentary miniseries The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross. Following the film, the students participated in a discussion with myself and our panelists—retired Chief Judge Robert M. Bell of the Maryland Court of Appeals and Professor Larry S. Gibson of the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law. It was a great honor to share the stage with these distinguished men.</p><p> The film and our panel discussion reflected on a period of particular hardship for many in our nation. But the Civil Rights Movement was also a time of great promise and bravery. It was a time when ordinary citizens reached deep within themselves to effect lasting change. This is a message that I was eager to share with these students—the idea that the age of social activism and community involvement are not over, and that change for Baltimore’s future will be built by our most tenacious and courageous citizens.</p><p> The impact that Black History has had on our everyday lives, and on our media, arts, and culture, was joyously apparent this week as the Paul Laurence Dunbar and Frederick Douglass Senior High School Jazz Bands spent the day in the rotunda of City Hall, performing for City employees and visitors. They were awesome! I want to thank these talented students, who put their hearts and souls into sharing the sounds of the jazz legends of years past. It was encouraging to watch them make history their own as they paid tribute to Black History. I look forward to seeing what this generation has in store as it continues to build upon that legacy.</p><p> I am also glad to know that this rising generation has great mentors and leaders to rely upon in their journey. This week I was thrilled to host the inaugural Mayor’s Divine Nine Presidents Awards. During this awards ceremony at City Hall, we took time to recognize members of the “Divine Nine” historically black fraternities and sororities for their service to Baltimore. The organizations of the Divine Nine—formally the National Pan-Hellenic Council—have served as beacons to our young adults and have continued to demonstrate a commitment to service in our communities. The Mayor’s Divine Nine Presidents Awards honored specific individuals who have exhibited the highest degree of ethics, professional conduct, leadership and initiative.</p><p> As Black History Month draws to a close, I am heartened to know that Baltimore has a bright future ahead. I encourage you to continue in a spirit of reflection throughout the year. The lessons of the past are one of the most powerful tools we possess as we work to build a better Baltimore.</p>","2/28/2014","Stronger Neighborhoods, Rawlings-Blake Review","Stronger Neighborhoods","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Educational Opportunity","<p>On May 17, 1954—nearly 60 years ago—the United States Supreme Court handed down a unanimous decision in the case of Brown vs. Board of Education. The decision clearly stated that “separate educational facilities are inherently unequal”—ending racial segregation in America’s schools.</p><p> This week, I was honored to host a panel discussion in partnership with the University of Baltimore College of Public Affairs on the 60 years following Brown vs. Board of Education. We discussed the impact of that landmark decision and acknowledged the historic efforts of Baltimore attorney (and later, Supreme Court Justice) Thurgood Marshall, who argued the case before the Supreme Court. The impact of that decision has rippled through generations, creating opportunity where it did not exist before.</p><p> However, for far too many of our youth, our education system is still very much separate and unequal. While students of color can now attend any school they choose, disparity still exists. We know that right here in Baltimore, many students are not afforded the same opportunities as their peers in other parts of the state and around the country. Baltimore’s school buildings are the oldest in the state—some are still standing from the 19th century. Dripping roofs, leaking foundations, unreliable heating & cooling systems, unusable bathrooms & water fountains—these have become the norm in our schools.</p><p> It is a billion dollar problem, and for many years all anyone would do was point fingers. The City said it was a State problem. The State said it was a City problem. The school system said it was both of our problems. In order to build a better school system, we had to grow beyond the tired arguments of the past and do something monumental for ALL of our children. That is why I fought so hard to secure up to $1.1 billion to build new schools and renovate several others across Baltimore. I cannot tell you what it means to me that future generations will finally see new schools, renovated schools, and first-class schools right here in Baltimore City. Because of this remarkable accomplishment we can build the school system our children deserve.</p><p> Building better schools is one of many efforts underway to provide African American students equal educational opportunity. This week we saw another exciting step in the right direction with the announcement of a new CEO for Baltimore City Public Schools. In Dr. Gregory Thornton, Baltimore has found a seasoned administrator, who also understands the demands of leading in our classrooms—because he began his career there. I am glad to welcome Dr. Thornton back to Maryland, and excited to work with him as we embark on a new season for Baltimore’s students.</p><p> As the daughter of a teacher, education has been a focal point in my life since I was young. The doors that education opened for my parents, for myself, and for my daughter have clearly demonstrated to me the importance of equal educational opportunity. As we continue to celebrate Black History Month, I am thankful for the bold and courageous citizens who made it possible for us to continue moving forward.</p>","2/21/2014","Better Schools, Rawlings-Blake Review","Better Schools","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Black History Month","<p>February is Black History Month, and this year, there is much to celebrate! 2014 marks the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act and the 150th anniversary of emancipation in Maryland. This year we have an amazing opportunity to recognize the Marylanders who fought for freedom from slavery and their descendants, who continue to struggle and triumph. I hope that, throughout the month, you will take the opportunity to seek out these stories.</p><p> Stories like that of Anne Brown (1912 – 2009), the native daughter of Baltimore who originated the role of Bess in George Gershwin’s Porgy & Bess. Earlier today, we were privileged to hear Brown’s story, presented through story and song by award-winning operatic recitalist, recording artist, actress, and author Bridgette “Bri” Cooper. Ms. Cooper has been named one of the Voices of the New Millennium, and was honored to be the first classical singer featured in Black Enterprise Magazine.</p><p> This performance was part of It’s More Than History!—a lunch & learn lecture series presented by the Baltimore National Heritage Area in conjunction with my office. In Commemoration of Black History Month, the February series of It’s More Than History! honors Baltimore’s African American community and contributions to music and the arts. Join us in City Hall at noon on February 21 for the next lecture in the series, which tells the story of Ellis Larkins, Baltimore’s “poet of the piano.” Events like this are taking place throughout the city during the whole month.</p><p> Last Saturday, I was pleased to join Congressman Elijah Cummings and featured guest Congressman John Lewis for the Enoch Pratt Free Library’s Black History Month kickoff, its 26th annual Booklovers’ Breakfast. Congressman Lewis—a U.S. Representative from Georgia—has spent his life honoring our nation’s African American heritage and fighting for equality and civil rights. In fact, he is the last surviving member of the “Big Six” leaders of the Civil Rights Movement. Hundreds of residents from book clubs across Baltimore attended the event, and it was an exciting reminder that great deeds are not confined to just history books.</p><p> Black History Month is also an opportunity for us to mobilize to overcome the challenges that are still far too prevalent in our communities of color. Today I joined with Baltimore Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot, Councilman Nick Mosby, and members of the community to recognize National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. In Baltimore City, African Americans account for 85% of all diagnosed HIV/AIDS cases. African Americans face the most severe HIV/AIDS burden of any ethnic group in the nation. This is an epidemic that disproportionately affects our black communities, and we must take action to stem the tide of new infections.</p><p> The stigma, fear, and silence associated with HIV/AIDS only serve to increase the risk of infection and decrease willingness to know one’s status. In Baltimore, no one should suffer in silence. Thanks to the leadership of the Baltimore City Health Department and partners like Total Healthcare, prevention efforts have helped to maintain stability in the overall level of HIV infections among African Americans for more than a decade, but we must pull together as a community. Get educated. Get tested. Get involved. And if you are currently living with HIV/AIDS, don’t be afraid or ashamed to get treated.</p><p> As we celebrate the heritage of our wonderfully diverse nation, let us bear in mind that our collective Baltimore story is not finished. The stories of our forebears that are recounted throughout Black History Month are a beginning. Through our continued commitment, passion, and courage, we will have many more stories to tell in years to come.</p>","2/7/2014","Stronger Neighborhoods, Cleaner and Healthier City, Rawlings-Blake Review","Stronger Neighborhoods, Cleaner and Healthier City","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Partnership for Jobs","<p>The Horseshoe Baltimore Casino will serve as an economic engine, driving new jobs, tax revenues, and increased development. From the beginning, Horseshoe has been committed to promoting local hiring and working with the Mayor’s Office of Employment Development to provide Baltimore City residents with information and access to the 1,700 jobs that it will create. The strong public-private partnership between the City and Horseshoe has resulted in a comprehensive recruitment strategy that could not have come at a better time, as many families are struggling to find job opportunities.</p><p> Last week, we announced the details of this expansive hiring program, which begins next month. Horseshoe Baltimore, working with the Mayor’s Office of Employment Development (MOED) and the Baltimore City Council, will conduct city-wide outreach to educate residents about available positions, job qualifications, and the application process.</p><p> The Horseshoe team and MOED will hold a number of neighborhood-based recruitment events. The team will employ promotion methods ranging from neighborhood canvassing to social media campaigns—in partnership with a wide range of community groups, neighborhood associations, and civic organizations—to spread the word. A complete schedule of neighborhood recruitment events is available at www.horseshoebaltimore.com.</p><p> As an additional resource, job seekers can enroll in Horseshoe Baltimore’s Legendary Candidates Academy, a series of two-day, six-hour training sessions operated at locations throughout the city in conjunction with MOED and its workforce partners. The sessions will provide in-depth information about the requirements for various positions, outline the pre-employment process, underscore Horseshoe Baltimore’s emphasis on exceptional customer service, and prepare candidates for position-specific interviews. Job seekers who successfully complete the Academy will receive special hiring consideration.</p><p> Horseshoe will promote open positions through the Baltimore City and Maryland chambers of commerce, and through partnerships with local colleges and universities, philanthropies, religious organizations, the National Pan-Hellenic Council (Divine Nine), and the Enoch Pratt Free Library. In addition, Horseshoe will utilize paid advertising, social media, and community association meetings to spread the work about employment opportunities.</p><p> Finally, Horseshoe Baltimore will host a series of large-scale hiring events at the Baltimore Convention Center (March 7 – 9), Hyatt Regency Baltimore (May 3 – 5), and M&T Bank Stadium (May 19 – 21).</p><p> We are pulling out all the stops to make sure that Baltimore residents have every opportunity to learn about and apply for jobs at the Casino. Horseshoe Baltimore means more business for our local tourism and hospitality economy. It means even more investment for a gateway into Baltimore. It means revenue to reduce property taxes and invest in our children’s education. And it means jobs for our residents.</p>","2/3/2014","Growing Economy, Rawlings-Blake Review","Growing Economy","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"A Safer City","<p>My administration’s top priority is to reduce crime in Baltimore.</p><p> Our crime fighting strategy is centered on apprehending the most violent repeat offenders, gangs, and drug dealers. When we released a strategic plan for the police department late last year, the report made clear that this is the right strategy. And I want to thank the Baltimore Police Department for all their hard work in 2013, including helping to take more than 1,800 guns off of Baltimore City streets and making more than 1,000 arrests of repeat and violent offenders.</p><p> But we must improve our execution of that strategy and build relationships between police and the community to begin seeing the crime reductions we all want to see.</p><p> Crime is down in virtually every major category but our homicide rate remains stubbornly high. There is too much blood being shed on our city streets and too many lives lost to senseless violence. We know that our current challenges will not improve with just a few thoughtful gestures or comments, and that it will require all of us to do a little more.</p><p> I am committed to driving violent crime down while maintaining a high level of mutual trust and confidence between police and the community. I refuse to accept the current situation as a way of life. Working together we can make Baltimore a safer place, now and in the future.</p>","1/17/2014","Safer Streets, Rawlings-Blake Review","Safer Streets","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Ensuring Food Access","<p>Earlier today, I announced the release of a new Prequalification Application for the Homegrown Baltimore Land Leasing Initiative, a partnership of the Baltimore Office of Sustainability and the City’s Department of Housing & Community Development. The initiative helps experienced farmers who are interested in creating nonprofit or for-profit urban farming ventures to lease vacant parcels of City-owned land. The newly released application builds on a 2011 pilot, which has already resulted in the execution of two urban farm leases covering three acres of City-owned land. Approximately 20 additional acres of vacant land are anticipated to be leased to farmers in the next 10 years. The new application will be open indefinitely, and farmers may apply at any time.</p><p> This announcement follows the adoption last month of Homegrown Baltimore: Grow Local, Baltimore’s Urban Agriculture Plan, which serves as a road map for the future of agriculture in Baltimore City. The plan offers history and context, and gives 25 detailed recommendations on how to effectively provide the land, water, soil, and access to capital that farmers need to continue to transform vacant land into valuable assets.</p><p> We have implemented a comprehensive plan that will guide our efforts to develop a local food system, support food production & food access in the city, and help revitalize Baltimore's communities through farming. With my Get Fresh initiative, we are also making great strides in improving access to local, affordable, and nutritious foods in Baltimore’s public markets.</p><p> Our public markets are some of the oldest and best in the nation, and they have been a priority for my administration. We have completed major renovations at the Avenue Market, Broadway Market, and just this week, Northeast Market.</p><p> The Northeast Market renovation focused on improvements that are visible, helping to change the perception of the market and encourage addition investment. But we also made some changes to promote healthy lifestyles. Ten vendors have agreed to participate in the Get Fresh initiative by putting green leaf labels on their menus to indicate healthier items. The market has also constructed a new day stall, which will be used for health & nutrition education, health screenings, and other health programs.</p><p> Considering the significant progress Baltimore has made for urban agriculture and food access, it is critical for Congress to pass a farm bill that will do the same. If Congress is unable to reach an agreement on a new bill that will support local foods, small & beginning farmers, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by December 31, growers and consumers will be significantly impacted.</p><p> The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office rated an increase in SNAP benefits as one of the two most cost-effective methods for boosting growth and jobs when the economy is weak. In 2012, SNAP kept nearly 5 million Americans out of poverty, including 2.2 million children. In More than 30 percent of Baltimore’s residents receive SNAP benefits—approximately 190,000 people. The farm bill has real consequences for families struggling to put food on the table, and time is of the essence.</p>","12/13/2013","Cleaner and Healthier City, Innovative Government, Stronger Neighborhoods, Rawlings-Blake Review","Cleaner and Healthier City, Innovative Government, Stronger Neighborhoods","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Season of Giving","<p>December 3, 2013 was the second annual #GivingTuesday. This initiative, which began in New York City, has spread across the world. In a growing economy that is bolstered by unofficial ‘holidays’ like Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday, #GivingTuesday urges everyone to devote the day to charity, give back to the community, and spread the word via social media or any means possible.</p><p> This year’s #GivingTuesday was particularly exciting in Baltimore, as we proved that we are the most generous city in America. I joined with local businesses and nonprofits to encourage Baltimore residents to give. The local campaign, Bmore Gives More, was organized by GiveCorps and set out to raise $5 million in just one day for more than 200 charitable organizations in Baltimore.</p><p> Donation incentives were offered throughout the day by local businesses, including B Bistro, Birrotecca, Dooby’s, Fleet Street Kitchen, Gertrude’s, Joe Squared, Tapas Teatro, Ten Ten, and The Helmand Restaurant. The Associated: Jewish Community Federation of Baltimore held an all-day phone-a-thon. CrossFit Federal Hill sponsored a BMGM workout of the day and set out a donation change jar. Some businesses even created special BMGM items and donated a percentage of the proceeds or provided matching funds from those items for #GivingTuesday.</p><p> Baltimore really stepped up to the plate. At the end of the day, not only had we met our $5 million goal, but we exceeded it by at least half a million dollars. Hundreds of local charities and programs will benefit from the generosity shown by Baltimoreans on #GivingTuesday. I want to thank everyone who made the Bmore Gives More initiative a resounding success.</p><p> I also want to take a moment to thank the Baltimore City employees who roll up their sleeves every day to provide the services that keep Baltimore running. Last week, I visited a number of City employees in their places of work to express my gratitude for their service.</p><p> I stopped by the Thomas J. Burke Fire Station (Oldtown) to visit with members of the Baltimore City Fire Department (BCFD). A number of changes have taken place at the station in the past year—over $300,000 in renovation and construction. Oldtown is also home to some of our newest fire apparatus. The men and women of the BCFD, under the leadership of Acting Fire Chief Jeffrey Segal, are truly heroes, and I was thankful for the opportunity to personally thank them for their service and commitment to making Baltimore a safer city.</p><p> I also visited the Mayor’s Office of Information Technology (MOIT), which is responsible for leveraging information technology to enhance productivity, broaden our capabilities, and reduce the City’s operating costs. The talented and dedicated MOIT staff, led by CIO Chris Tonjes, have given us a year of great accomplishments, including advances in bridging the digital divide, implementing next generation infrastructure, and building a more innovative, transparent government. You may or may not know that the men and women of MOIT are responsible for operation of the City's 311 dispatch center—which operates 365 days a year—and the City’s CCTV crime prevention system, CitiWatch. I can't wait to see even more innovation from them in the future.</p><p> I want to, again, thank everyone at BCFD and MOIT for the work they do every day. I look forward visiting with employees at other City agencies in the new year.</p><p> During this season of giving, it is great to know that Baltimore IS the most generous city in America. I have always said that in Baltimore, we come together, we roll up our sleeves, and we get things done.</p>","12/9/2013","Stronger Neighborhoods, Innovative Government, Rawlings-Blake Review","Stronger Neighborhoods, Innovative Government","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Mayor for a Day","<p>I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving! As we work each day to help Baltimore City overcome its challenges and become the great American city that we know it can be—and as we focus on these challenges and opportunities for growth—it is important that we not lose sight of all that we have to be thankful for.</p><p> Earlier this week, I had the privilege of spending the day with a couple of Baltimore’s outstanding youths, whom I invited to be Mayor for a Day. Let me introduce these two exemplary young women.</p><p> Michaela Smith attends Roland Park Elementary/Middle School. She was recently crowned Miss Maryland Junior High School. She loves helping and improving her community and has been working on a project to eradicate bullying. Michaela’s mother is a breast cancer survivor, which has impacted the way Michaela views service. She has dedicated the efforts of her own business, Hairbands for Hope, to raise over $500 to support Susan G. Komen.</p><p> Asia McCallum is a senior at Forest Park High. She is currently building a nonprofit called The Optimistic Party and working to obtain patents for a number of products. Asia recently competed in the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship National Youth Entrepreneurship Challenge with her business Fortunate!, which sells jumbo, personality-filled fortune cookies. She is a regional winner of the Scholastic Writing Awards and a Youth Service America grantee. Asia has a passion for environmental conservation and has been a work study student at the National Aquarium for the last three years.</p><p> After I welcomed Mayor Michaela and Mayor Asia to City Hall, our first stop was a ceremonial groundbreaking for the new MTA bus maintenance facility at Kirk Avenue. Michaela and Asia met some of our local, state, and federal elected officials at the groundbreaking, and saw how these three levels of government are able to work together in partnership to get great things done in our city.</p><p> After the groundbreaking, we headed to the Northwest Community Action Center and then to Moveable Feast. Throughout the month of November, City employees have collected non-perishable food items to provide Thanksgiving relief to families in need. Since Michaela and Asia are both involved in community service, it was a great opportunity for them to make connections and to offer service to others.</p><p> Our final stop for the afternoon was a meeting of the Mayor’s Coalition on Supplier Diversity and Inclusion. This newly sworn commission works to ensure that the City’s minority and women-owned business development programs are doing as much as possible to provide equal opportunity for Baltimore’s minority and women-owned businesses. This was a particularly enlightening meeting for these young ladies, as entrepreneurs.</p><p> It is my hope that Mayor for a Day gave these young women—future leaders in Baltimore's communities—a valuable glimpse into city government. But the program was not just a great opportunity for Mayor Michaela and Mayor Asia. I am also thankful for the opportunity that I had to spend the day with these promising young women. Their excitement, eagerness, and optimism are exactly the qualities we need to build a better, safer, stronger Baltimore. Mayor for a Day was a great success, and I will make sure that our children continue to have opportunities like this in the future.</p>","11/29/2013","Innovative Government, Rawlings-Blake Review","Innovative Government","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Safer Streets","<p>Earlier this week, I joined Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts and community leaders committed to reducing crime in Baltimore City to release the new strategic plan for the Baltimore Police Department. The report, entitled Public Safety in the City of Baltimore: A Strategic Plan for Improvement, contains comprehensive and far-ranging recommendations, including the implementation of best practices seen across the country.</p><p> Reducing crime is my administration’s top priority. We have made progress, but none of us are satisfied. I will never shake the feeling I get from having to console a family who has lost a loved one to senseless violence. Their faces and their stories continue to strengthen my resolve in fighting for a safer Baltimore.</p><p> The new strategic plan provides us with a thoughtful set of recommendations for how to more effectively move forward and meet the current challenges we face in the fight against crime. It details steps the police department will undertake over the next five years to reduce crime, improve services, increase efficiency, redouble community engagement, and maintain the highest standards of accountability and ethical integrity.</p><p> The report is the result of a months-long top-down review of the Baltimore Police Department, conducted by the Strategic Police Partnership, led by Robert Wasserman, along with the Bratton Group, comprised of nationally recognized law enforcement experts. The comprehensive review provided a thorough and stringent analysis of practices, methods, and procedures across all nine police districts and through every unit in the agency.</p><p> Commissioner Batts echoed my sentiments when he said, “We know that there are things as an organization that we are incredibly good at. We also know there exist areas that can be improved. It is my goal to give the officers protecting this city the tools to do their job better…faster…smarter. The strategic recommendations presented [in the plan] are a road map to that goal.”</p><p> Even before the report was released, we had already put in place many of its recommended reforms. Our strategy to reduce crime throughout the city by targeting illegal guns, gang activity, and repeat violent offenders correlates directly with the strategic plan. The police department’s renewed focus on community relations and engagement are also mirrored in the report.</p><p> We have implemented reforms including improvements to suspect identification procedures, upgrades to law enforcement equipment, the creation of a Telephone Reporting Unit and Professional Standards Bureau, and modifications to the speed at which data is collected and resources are allocated.</p><p> If you would like to know more about the future direction of our crime fighting efforts, Public Safety in the City of Baltimore: A Strategic Plan for Improvement can be read in its entirety online.</p>","11/22/2013","Safer Streets, Innovative Government, Rawlings-Blake Review","Safer Streets, Innovative Government","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Vacants to Value","<p>This past Tuesday, we celebrated the third anniversary of Baltimore’s acclaimed Vacants to Value initiative. When I formed Vacants to Value, the mission was clear: to get Baltimore’s vacant and abandoned properties cleaned up and redeveloped more quickly, more efficiently, and more economically.</p><p> Three years later, Vacants to Value has helped to initiate the rehabilitation of 1,400 vacant properties, demolition of 700 dilapidated structures, and adoption & greening of over 800 lots by community groups. Over 500 homebuyer assistance grants have been awarded through the program.</p><p> But our work is far from done. This week we redoubled our efforts by re-launching Vacants to Value with a fresh look and a new website, as well as an upgraded Baltimore Homeownership Incentives Program (B-HiP). With the new B-HiP, we are increasing Baltimore City employee homeownership incentives from $3,000 to $5,000 and increasing Live Baltimore’s Buying Into Baltimore incentive from $4,000 to $5,000. We are also campaigning to double employer and employee participation in the Live Near Your Work.</p><p> This is an exciting time for our city—particularly for all of the neighborhoods across Baltimore that are being improved because of this innovative program. Baltimore is steeped in history, culture, and pride. Our more than 200 neighborhoods make up the urban heart of Maryland, and Vacants to Value is about preserving and enhancing the splendor of this magnificent city. It’s about attracting new residents and bringing relief to families that have called Baltimore home for decades.</p><p> For me, the true measure of success is in the faces of the communities—and families—that are being transformed for the better because of our efforts.</p><p> On Tuesday I was pleased to stand with Ms. Cynite Cooke on the steps of what is soon to be her new home—a formerly vacant property that is being rehabilitated through Vacants to Value. Ms. Cooke moved to Baltimore to work as a teacher for Baltimore City Public Schools. After living here for a few years, she decided to put down roots in the city by taking advantage of the numerous homeownership incentives we have put in place. Her heart has been in Baltimore for years, but with the help of Vacants to Value, she is now able to make Baltimore her home. Stories like Ms. Cooke’s are happening all over Baltimore and are exactly how we will grow our city one resident at a time.</p><p> Our third anniversary celebration culminated with the latest Vacants to Value demolition success story. After years of waiting, community members watched as a number of blighted structures in the 1300 block of Hillman Avenue were finally torn down. After the space is cleared, beginning next year we are going to consolidate the lots and lease the space out as an urban farm.</p><p> I am committed to working every day to make each community in Baltimore stronger, and I’m grateful to be mayor of a city with so many community partners who are willing to step up and work with government to move our city forward. Let’s keep up the fight, and together, I know we can make Baltimore’s future even brighter.</p>","11/15/2013","Stronger Neighborhoods, Innovative Government, Rawlings-Blake Review","Stronger Neighborhoods, Innovative Government","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Ensuring Economic Opportunity","<p>One of my top priorities is to ensure that all businesses have the opportunity to compete and succeed. My goal of growing the city by 10,000 families cannot happen without the growth of small and independent businesses that create jobs and economic opportunity for all. Our minority-owned and women-owned business enterprises (MWBEs) are essential for Baltimore’s growth.</p><p> In keeping with our vision of creating a business-friendly Baltimore, I designated October 28 – November 1, 2013 as Supplier Diversity and Inclusion Week in Baltimore. Activities during the week have provided a forum to recognize and strengthen small, minority-owned, and women-owned businesses. One of the anchors of Supplier Diversity and Inclusion Week was the 7th annual Top 100 MBE Awards, which highlighted some of the region’s most extraordinary MWBEs.</p><p> The Top 100 MBEs program is a region-wide effort, recognizing minority- and women-owned businesses in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Delaware, and the District of Columbia. Each of the Top 100 MBEs serves, in one way or another, as a model for success and an example of the tremendous impact that the MWBE community is having on our nation and our economy. As mayor of Baltimore, I am thrilled to congratulate the 2013 Top 100 MBEs and thank the entire regional MWBE community for their work to strengthen this pillar of a growing economy.</p><p> MWBEs are major contributors to our national, state, and local economies, which add great value to the City of Baltimore. Successful entrepreneurial undertakings like these provide jobs, promote economic growth, and diversify our economy—attracting new residents and improving the quality of life in our communities.</p><p> Minority- and women-owned businesses continue to progress and succeed against very real challenges, including disparity in access to venture capital and deal flow, as well as roadblocks in obtaining critical, timely information—particularly when it comes to government and private procurement. I understand the importance of diversity in business all too well, and I am serious about equitable inclusion.</p><p> I want Baltimore to become an entrepreneurial Mecca. I want our city to attract businesses from across the nation and around the globe, to focus on retaining and growing the businesses that we already have, and to invest in promising new ventures for Baltimore’s citizens. The City of Baltimore is committed to the success of minority- and women-owned businesses, and we are constantly working toward this goal.</p><p> Earlier this year, the Mayor’s Advisory Council on Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprises—comprised of local business leaders and nationally-renowned experts—released its report, A New Day, A Better Way, after an extensive examination of best practices. The advisory council made bold suggestions to address fundamental obstacles in City’s MWBE program, creating a platform for the program’s future direction.</p><p> Just last month, I announced that Baltimore has been awarded a $900,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) to operate a business center that will facilitate collaborative efforts among minority-owned firms and Fortune 500 companies, broadening our MWBEs’ access to resources on a national level. The MBDA Business Center will actively work to address the under-representation of MWBE firms in the mainstream business marketplace.</p><p> To continue the work of the Mayor’s Advisory Council on Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprises, I have formed the Mayor’s Coalition on Supplier Diversity and Inclusion. The coalition, which has already begun its work, will advise the City on matters related to inclusion and diversity and ask the tough questions that need to be addressed. They will serve as champions for business and assist with the oversight and implementation of the recommendations made by the advisory council.</p>","11/1/2013","Growing Economy, Innovative Government, Rawlings-Blake Review","Growing Economy, Innovative Government","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"21st Century Schools","<p>Baltimore has thrived during tough economic times while many other cities throughout the nation have fallen short—thanks to tough decisions that keep the City moving forward. Some of those tough decisions have meant asking each of us to kick in a little more for the long term fiscal health of our city and to make sure that we are investing in the next generation. The bottle tax serves as prime example. The tax played a vital role in closing a massive budget deficit without cutting important city services; and more importantly, it was essential in securing a $1.1 billion investment in construction funds for Baltimore City schools.</p><p> When we increased the tax from 2 cents to 5 cents, I was clear that revenue from the tax would go toward making Baltimore City Public Schools facilities better. And thanks partly to this revenue, the City was able to double its annual commitment to school construction—from roughly $17 million annually to about $38 million dollars—the largest increase in local city funding for school construction in Baltimore’s history.</p><p> Our increased annual commitment enabled us to go to Annapolis with a stronger argument that Baltimore’s youth deserved more. As a result, during the 2013 Maryland General Assembly session, Baltimore secured a $1.1 billion investment for school construction.</p><p> The Baltimore City Public School Construction and Revitalization Act of 2013 is the most important legislative achievement for the city in decades. It represents a landmark renewal in the partnership between the City and the State to rebuild schools, ensuring that all kids are able to sit in a clean, modern and safe building. The funding is expected to support construction of as many as 15 new replacement schools and more than 30 significantly renovated schools over 10 years.</p><p> The legislation called for a memorandum of understanding between the City, State, Baltimore City Public Schools, and the Maryland Stadium Authority. The MOU—which formalizes the roles that each of these partners will play in the billion dollar plan to revitalize Baltimore’s schools—went before the Maryland Board of Public Works on Wednesday. It was unanimously approved.</p><p> But the plan doesn’t work without revenue streams like the bottle tax that support the $1.1 billion in bonds.</p><p> We are at the beginning of a very exciting time for Baltimore, but our vision of growing Baltimore by 10,000 families in the next decade depends greatly on our ability to improve public education. As mayor, and as mother of a public school student, I know how important education is. I will always continue to fight for better schools across Baltimore.</p>","10/18/2013","Better Schools, Innovative Government, Rawlings-Blake Review","Better Schools, Innovative Government","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Governing for the People","<p>The ongoing federal government shutdown has had a real and negative impact on our country. A partisan battle over our nation’s budget has ground our national government to a halt.</p><p> But at the local level, there is no time for drawn-out political battles to stop government from performing its basic duties. In local government, the only choice is to act, because failure means real and immediate consequences for your city. At the end of the day, everyone involved understands that there is an obligation to act when people depend on you to govern. You simply have to roll up your sleeves and get the job done. And in Baltimore, we seeing genuine benefits from the ways in which our governments are working for the people.</p><p> For example, to families who have struggled to find access to quality and affordable healthcare, the new federal Affordable Care Act means new options to access the healthcare they need. It means no longer having to fear bankruptcy because of a loved one’s illness or having to choose between putting food on the table and buying medication. And that’s outstanding news for more than 80,000 Baltimore citizens who have lacked healthcare access.</p><p> A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that nearly 80% of Americans favor the benefits provided by the Affordable Care Act: health insurance exchanges, subsidies to help individuals purchase insurance, and the expansion of Medicaid—benefits that will help to insure families across Baltimore.</p><p> I encourage you to spend some time finding out for yourself what this law can do for you. Don’t listen to naysayers who would base their opinions more on politics than on what the legislation can do for low-income and middle class families. Take time to visit the website or speak with a professional who can help you make the best choice for you and your family.</p><p> In local government, positive reforms are happening as well. Earlier this week, I shared a series of steps that my administration has taken to reduce tax credit errors in Baltimore City. These errors, many of which occurred over ten years ago, have frustrated tax credit recipients and caused residents to lose confidence in government. I share those frustrations, and I realize how upsetting these errors can be. I want to ensure that city government is giving Baltimore’s citizens the most accurate information possible—particularly when it comes to their finances.</p><p> I was determined to not have my administration kick the can down the road and let another ten years go by before this problem was addressed. We have worked diligently and proactively to identify errors, and through the Billing Integrity Unit that I established, we have put mechanisms in place to crack down on mistakes. In just three years, the unit has identified more savings for Baltimore ($15 million) than was lost over the previous 10 years due to errors. Just this year alone, we have identified more than 1,300 errors.</p><p> I believe that these measures will go a long way toward building confidence in the City’s ability to provide correct tax bills and show hard working residents that my administration will not rest until the system is dramatically improved. Leveraging automated technology and more advanced techniques, the reforms will greatly reduce the possibility of tax errors caused by human mistakes and ensure that recipients get the right bill for their property.</p><p> In response to the original tax credit errors two resolutions were introduced in the City Council asking the administration to consider privatizing tax calculations and collections and to conduct an audit of the City’s tax programs.</p><p> I'm not opposed to audits; audits happen all the time in government. In fact, audits were taking place over the last 10 years—yet they still failed to fix this problem. While I share the Council’s concern and look forward to working with them in partnership to continue improving the system, we must give the reforms that have been put in place a chance to take full effect first so that Baltimore’s citizens will know if our reforms are heading in the right direction.</p><p> At the same time, we should be looking for areas where additional improvements can be made. Working together with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation, I know we can continue moving forward on critical improvements that the citizens of Baltimore deserve.</p>","10/11/2013","Innovative Government, Rawlings-Blake Review","Innovative Government","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Better Schools","<p>One week ago today, I joined with students at Frederick Elementary School to kick off the 2nd annual Mayor’s School Attendance Campaign. The competition will highlight community efforts to fight truancy in Baltimore City Schools and work with partners to encourage youth to get to school on time and ready to learn.</p><p> Each year, 15 percent of Baltimore City elementary students are chronically absent, missing more than 20 days of school over the course of the school year. Over the course of their first five years in school, 36 percent of Baltimore’s youngest students are chronically absent during at least one year.</p><p> Data from city schools confirm what we already know to be true: students who regularly make it to class perform better than students who don't come to school—specifically, 16 percent better in reading and 22 percent better in math during the 2012-2013 school year.</p><p> We want all of our children to succeed—which is why we started this attendance competition in partnership with a number of community sponsors. The theme of this year’s campaign is “It takes a Baltimore community to raise a child.” They may not all be our children by birth, but they are all our children by community—we are one Baltimore. Everyone in our city has a stake in making sure these kids succeed.</p><p> Throughout the school year, schools across the city will compete for fun and prizes. The school with the greatest improvement in attendance, as compared to the same period last year, will win exciting incentives that will benefit students, school administrators, and the community.</p><p> For the 2013 – 2014 competition program, schools within specified grade brackets will compete with one another. Brackets for pre-K – kindergarten and 1st – 8th grades will compete from September 30 to November 25. The 9th – 12th grade bracket will compete from March 3 – May 12. The winning school in each grade bracket will receive a monetary award. Students at the winning school will receive incentives to continue to build a stronger educational environment, like tickets to a Baltimore Blast game or a pizza party, and 100 lucky students from the winning school will get to attend a party celebrating their success.</p><p> This year’s campaign is made possible by our partners, including Comcast, Baltimore Blast, Under Armour, Port Discovery, and Domino’s Pizza.</p>","10/7/2013","Better Schools, Rawlings-Blake Review","Better Schools","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Building a Safer City","<p>Last Monday, we received news from Washington, DC that yet another horrifying act of gun violence robbed innocent Americans of their lives. Tragedies like the incident at the Washington Navy Yard make our hearts heavy, and our deepest sympathies go out to the loved ones of those we lost. Events like these should be few and far between, but as mayor of a major American city, I know that gun violence rocks our communities far too often.</p><p> Last week, I joined Marylanders to Prevent Gun Violence to stand in support of the Firearms Safety Act of 2013, which will go into effect on October 1. It is important to me that I stand in support of the safety of our communities, not just as mayor, but also in most important position I will ever hold—as a mom. My heart aches for every mother who has ever experienced the tragedy of losing a child to violence. I do not want to lose any more of our children to senseless violence.</p><p> I want to share with you a few of the programs in place here in Baltimore that help prevent and reduce gun violence in our city.</p><p> The Youth Diversion Program targets youth with no significant delinquency or criminal history who are arrested for misdemeanor offenses. The program provides diversion options such as teen court, community conferencing, aggression replacement, substance abuse treatment, and mental health treatment as alternatives to the juvenile justice system. The Youth Diversion Program is important because it diverts vulnerable youth away from the formal justice system while holding them accountable for their actions.</p><p> Through the High-risk Youth Prevention and Enforcement (HYPE) program, the Mayor’s Office on Criminal Justice coordinates local and state stakeholders—focusing specifically on the most high-risk youth—to identify policing, prosecution, and service strategies to prevent and reduce violence. Recently, HYPE addressed a sharp rise in juvenile-involved robberies and sprang into action. Through a collaborative effort, we learned that the increase was related to a growing school-based gang and its recruiting practices. Through targeted curfew checks, home visits, and increased neighborhood patrols, we were able to significantly decrease youth-related robberies.</p><p> Operation Safe Kids aims to prevent youth from becoming victims or perpetrators of violent crimes by ensuring they have the tools they need to become productive adults, and by providing intensive, community-based case management and monitoring of high-risk youth offenders. The program also includes services for reentry youth to ease the transition from long-term out-of-home placement back into the community.</p><p> Safe Streets Baltimore, a community mobilization and outreach program to combat gun violence, has five core components: community coalition building, street outreach to at-risk youth, public education, clergy involvement, and law enforcement collaboration. Safe Streets targets high-risk youth aged 14 – 25 through outreach and service connection. It also targets the community as a whole through mobilization and media campaigns. Through a strong street outreach component including neighborhood canvassing, the program focuses on connecting with high-risk youth and young adults during evenings and weekends to link them to services and diffuse potentially harmful situations.</p><p> Thanks to efforts like these, Baltimore City has seen a significant decline in youth arrests since 2010, and we are on-pace to see those numbers continue to fall.</p><p> I have set a goal to grow Baltimore by 10,000 families over the next decade. But reducing crime, increasing economic opportunity, and improving the quality of life in our city are goals that require strong partnerships between citizens, law enforcement, and city government. As we work together toward our shared vision, I know that we can build a better Baltimore.</p>","9/23/2013","Safer Streets, Rawlings-Blake Review","Safer Streets","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Transit for a Growing Economy","<p>Last Wednesday, I joined Governor Martin O’Malley, Lt. Governor Anthony Brown, and Congressman Elijah Cummings to announce nearly $1.5 billion in transportation investments for the Baltimore Metropolitan Region. Among other things, these funds will support operation of the Charm City Circulator, improve existing MARC commuter service and add weekend service, provide for upgrades to the Metro rail car fleet and signaling systems, and prove our commitment to the construction of the Baltimore Red Line.</p><p> This $1.5 investment in building a world class transit system will support more than 13,000 jobs—including 4,500 construction jobs and 200 permanent jobs associated with the Red Line alone. And the Red Line will not only create jobs, it will also give Baltimore residents greater access to jobs and more options for getting to and from work—wherever they work. The Red Line, in conjunction with Baltimore’s existing public transit options, will provide a convenient, efficient way to crisscross the region without the burden of driving through traffic or enduring a long commute.</p><p> When completed, the Red Line will connect major job centers in two of Maryland’s major jurisdictions: Medicare/Medicaid in western Baltimore County and Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in East Baltimore. It will also finally connect the metro, light rail, bus system, and MARC trains to create the most comprehensive transportation system Baltimore has ever seen.</p><p> Last week’s announcement is a great example of how state, local, and federal governments can work together to improve the quality of life in Baltimore. I look forward to having a cohesive transit system that will help residents reduce commute times, avoid gridlock, decrease their carbon footprint, and—most important—spend more time with their families.</p>","9/9/2013","Innovative Government, Growing Economy, Rawlings-Blake Review","Innovative Government, Growing Economy","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Uniting for Change","<p>Fifty years ago, our nation saw a day like no other in its history—a day when Americans of every age, creed, and color came together to push for their dream of equality for all. I am humbled and inspired by those hearts, minds, and souls that demanded equality and change on that historic day in August.</p><p> This week, as we have commemorated the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, we have taken time to remember all that it stood for. We have reflected upon the progress that has been made over the past 5 decades—and the sacrifice, dedication, and cooperation it has taken to get us where we are now.</p><p> We owe so much to the hundreds of thousands of courageous and passionate citizens who convened in Washington 50 years ago. They proved without a doubt that when we are united for change, we can accomplish great things. We can reach our dreams.</p><p> Today, the torch has been passed to us—let’s keep it lit. It is our duty to keep the spirit of those marchers alive and to build on their dream of equality for all. It is our time.</p><p> We must keep marching.</p>","8/30/2013","Stronger Neighborhoods, Rawlings-Blake Review","Stronger Neighborhoods","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Moving Forward Together","<p>Earlier this week, the City of Baltimore reached a contract agreement with the two unions representing employees of the Baltimore City Fire Department (BCFD)—Baltimore Firefighters IAFF Local 734 and the Baltimore Fire Officers Association IAFF Local 964. The new contract, which was voted on and overwhelmingly approved by members of the unions, includes increased salaries, a modified shift structure, and guarantees no layoffs or demotions as a result of the contract.</p><p> Under the new three-year agreement, BCFD employees will receive a 2% pay raise for FY13. Then on January 1, 2014, fire suppression personnel will receive an additional 14.5% raise, and EMS and other personnel will receive a 4% raise. Additionally, the longevity raises that firefighters receive at 20 and 25 years will be increased to 5%, up from the current 4% raise.</p><p> The contract also outlines a new shift structure for fire suppression personnel, more in line with practices found in other major U.S. cities. The modified structure calls for a 12.5% increase in hours worked. Under the new schedule, fire suppression personnel will be on-duty for 24 hours, off-duty for the next 24 hours, and on-duty for the subsequent 24 hours. This scheduling model requires only 103 scheduled appearances yearly—79 fewer than the current schedule.</p><p> This new contract aligns closely with the city’s ten-year financial plan, Change to Grow, which calls for a bold set of major reforms to confront a $750 million structural deficit and to grow Baltimore.</p><p> Acting Fire Chief Jeffrey R. Segal said of the contract, “These changes will save the city millions of dollars and prevent possible layoffs. The contract is the result of good-faith negotiations between city officials, fire department management, and union leadership.”</p><p> And I couldn’t agree more. Baltimore’s firefighters are the best in America, and we are all deeply grateful for their hard work and bravery. This contract—with a new schedule and significantly increased pay—will allow our fire department to maintain its high standard of emergency services for our city. I am appreciative that the members of the department acknowledge the importance of long-term fiscal stability for our city and have courageously voted to make changes that will benefit all.</p>","8/23/2013","Innovative Government, Rawlings-Blake Review","Innovative Government","The Rawlings-Blake Review"

"Artscape!","<p>Summer in Baltimore means Old Bay crab feasts, refreshing snowballs, rooting for the O’s at Camden Yards, and festivals, festivals, festivals—including Artscape! This weekend’s 32nd annual Artscape, America’s largest free celebration of the visual and performing arts, is expected to (once again) attract more than 350,000 people and generate an economic impact of more than $25 million dollars for Baltimore City.</p><p> This year, Artscape celebrates the visual and performing arts with an international theme that will take you on an arts journey across the world. More than 30 countries will be represented—from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. The exhibition No Passport Required will present a mile-long mash-up of artists showcasing the festival’s international theme.</p><p> Artscape, also known for its exciting variety of music performances, features concerts on four outdoor stages. The biggest stage, the Wells Fargo Main Stage, welcomes exciting performers like R&B singer KEM on Friday, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band and the North Mississippi All Stars on Saturday, and reggae legends The Wailers on Sunday. The return of Squonk Opera’s Go Roadshow offers a musical spectacular on wheels, and Ten Thousand Brushes & The Baltimore Mural Experience allows festival-goers to participate in the creation of a pop-up mural. The Art Car Show, now celebrating its 20th year at Artscape, will form a fun “used car lot.” And Artscape After Hours will transform Charles Street into an outdoor dance club with DJs, lighting, lasers and special effects.</p><p> But Artscape can’t be limited to just this weekend, or contained within the boundaries of the festival! The M&T Bank Artscape Gallery Network, which began in June and runs through August, showcases artists at two dozen galleries throughout the metro area. And the Artscape in the Neighborhood program shines a spotlight on the many activities taking place in Bolton Hill, Mount Vernon, and the Station North Arts & Entertainment District.</p><p> Now, for the first time, a mobile Artscape app is available for Apple and Android devices. It’s a terrific new way to keep up-to-date with the festival schedule, Artists’ Market participants, food vendors, events, and more.</p><p> Artscape is a unique annual event, the likes of which you can only find in a great American city like Baltimore. It is a time to come together, to see old friends and meet new ones, to greet talented artists (and their creations), and to see the world in a whole new way. Standing among the unique clothing and jewelry, smelling the great food, and hearing the wonderful music, we have an opportunity to renew our love for Baltimore at an exciting time in our history—for the first time in decades, Baltimore is growing again!</p><p> We are reforming government, tearing down more blight than ever before, building new schools and recreation centers, and focusing on lowering crime in our communities—all while reducing property taxes for residents. We are convincing more families to stay, and attracting new families to our great neighborhoods.</p><p> Artscape is one of Baltimore’s most dynamic, exciting, and cherished annual events, and in the coming years, we look forward to introducing new families to this great Baltimore tradition. I hope to see you this weekend at Artscape!</p>","7/19/2013","Stronger Neighborhoods, Rawlings-Blake Review","Stronger Neighborhoods","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Safer Streets","<p>Yesterday, I was joined by Commissioner Batts and two of our strong partners—State’s Attorney Gregg Bernstein and U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, who are working with us every day to reduce crime and violence in Baltimore. In order to enhance our efforts, we announced new city funding to hire two assistant state’s attorneys, who will be detailed to the U.S. Attorney’s Office as special assistant U.S. attorneys for the investigation and federal prosecution of violent criminals in designated neighborhoods in East and West Baltimore.</p><p> I strongly believe that one of the reasons Baltimore has made progress over the last decade is because of stronger relationships between all criminal justice partners. Since taking office in 2010, I have made it clear that I will do everything I can to support their efforts, because reducing violence is the number one priority of my administration. And that is what yesterday’s announcement was about—enhancing our partnership as Baltimore’s crime fighters, all working together to get violent offenders and illegal guns off the street.</p><p> No one in our neighborhoods should have to live in fear of gun violence—I just won’t stand for it. We will not be satisfied until Baltimore becomes one of the safest big cities in America and residents feel safe in their neighborhoods and homes.</p><p> By focusing resources on specific, selected areas and individuals, we expect a more direct impact on those neighborhoods that have seen the greatest incidence of violent criminal activity. In addition, federal prosecution provides greater opportunity to obtain significant sentences that will keep these individuals off the street for longer. Finally, defendants will be incarcerated in distant federal prison facilities—separated from their affiliates, and unable to continue their criminal actions from behind bars.</p><p> The new prosecutors will enhance our ability to identify the most dangerous offenders—the worst of the worst—in the neighborhoods that have struggled most with crime, and to prosecute these criminals in the federal system, where the severity of punishment is often greater than in the state system.</p><p> To prosecute violent repeat offenders to the fullest extent of the law, we must utilize all available resources—local, state, and federal. We will stand together to do everything we can to apprehend, prosecute, and convict these offenders.</p>","7/12/2013","Safer Streets, Rawlings-Blake Review","Safer Streets","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"A Safer City","<p>I have to share with you how angry I am about what has occurred in Baltimore over the past week. We have seen a terrible display of ugly, senseless violence. The cowards that have perpetrated these violent acts are a disgrace to our city, and we will do everything possible to apprehend them and bring them to justice.</p><p> Reducing violence is my number one priority and the number one priority of my administration. Too many of our residents feel unsafe in their neighborhoods—even inside their own homes. This is unacceptable, and I will not tolerate it. We will not be satisfied until Baltimore becomes one of the safest big cities in America and all of our residents feel safe in their neighborhoods.</p><p> I’ve made it clear to Commissioner Batts that he and the men and women of the Baltimore Police Department have my full support, and they will have the resources needed to target repeat violent offenders, gangs, and illegal guns.</p><p> We ask for the community’s increased support and cooperation with the police. It is during these times that the partnership between police and residents is most critical. Our officers must be able to get the information they need to do their jobs, track down suspects, and make our communities safer.</p><p> I want to again emphasize the importance of stopping the flow of illegal guns into America’s cities. There is only one gun store in Baltimore City. It is clear that not enough is being done to disrupt the pipeline of illegal guns into our city.</p><p> At last week’s US Conference of Mayors annual conference, I met with my fellow mayors from across the country, and this issue was front-and-center. It needs to be front-and-center with Congress as well. Vice President Biden assured mayors that the Obama administration is committed to pressing forward. We need commonsense laws—including stronger background checks and federal enforcement—to help crack down on illegal guns. An overwhelming majority of Americans support stronger background checks, and both sides of the aisle must work together on a solution.</p><p> During the course of the next few weeks and beyond , I will continue to visit our officers in police districts to show them that we support the work they are doing and I’ll be visiting neighborhoods across the city to encourage increased cooperation and to build stronger partnerships with the community. Please join our cause to make Baltimore a safer city.</p>","6/28/2013","Safer Streets, Rawlings-Blake Review","Safer Streets","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Renovating Firehouses, Training U.S. Soldiers","<p>This week, I was joined by Peter C. Hinz, Assistant Adjutant General of Maryland for the U.S. Army, Maryland National Guard, to celebrate a kitchen renovation project at the Baltimore City Fire Department’s stationhouse for Engine 45. The project, led by members of the Maryland National Guard’s 244th Engineer Company, is the first in a newly developed partnership between the City of Baltimore and the Maryland National Guard.</p><p> Last year, the 244th Engineer Company reached out to my office to identify opportunities for the company to conduct innovative readiness training projects in the city. We identified fire departments with old kitchens in need of remodeling. In some cases, firefighters had stopped cooking in their kitchens due to the poor condition of the stoves and sinks.</p><p> Engine 45, located in Northwest Baltimore on Glenn Avenue, was built in 1951 and was in need of restoration. The 244th Engineer Company gutted the kitchen, cleaned it, painted the ceiling, and installed cabinets, countertops and fixtures. New fixtures include a sink, garbage disposal, stove, range hood, and seven electrical outlets. The materials were provided by the city, and all labor was provided by the National Guard.</p><p> We are grateful to the Maryland National Guard for working with us to find training opportunities for soldiers and to improve the conditions in our aging firehouses. It is a natural partnership for us, because our first responders often train with Guard members to prepare for natural and manmade disasters. This new partnership to renovate firehouses throughout the city will allow firefighters eat home-cooked meals and fully utilize the kitchens and other facilities in their stations.</p><p> The 244th Engineer Company is scheduled to provide construction support in Afghanistan, starting in November 2013. The company expects to be building infrastructure for the Afghan National Army. Their deployment departure ceremony is scheduled for September 28, 2013.</p>","6/21/2013","Innovative Government, Rawlings-Blake Review","Innovative Government","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Thanking Our First Responders","<p>On the night of Friday, June 14, Baltimore City police officers responded to an auto accident on I-83, the Jones Falls Expressway. As is common practice, the Department of Transportation also deployed a tow truck to remove the vehicle and ease traffic congestion. This set of events is not out of the ordinary, and is something we do on a routine basis on the JFX. But on Friday, this particular situation escalated, becoming a crisis when a passing driver struck the emergency vehicles on the shoulder, injuring the responding officer, and throwing the tow truck driver over the barrier into the Jones Falls below.</p><p> While emergency units responded to the accident on the highway, quick-thinking police officers responded. They rushed down the embankment and crossed the rushing water to be by the driver’s side. They stabilized him, and waited for the Fire Department to arrive with an extraction team.</p><p> The Fire Department was notified that someone had been thrown off the JFX, and dispatch deployed members of the Special Operations Command to the scene. In 2012, we overhauled the SOC and moved it to a permanent location in Locust Point. This change makes it possible for us to quickly deploy rescue teams anywhere in the city—including to Friday night’s scene below the JFX.</p><p> When the SOC team arrived, police officers had stabilized the driver, but he still needed to be removed from the middle of the rising river. With all the rain we had last week, the river was higher and rougher than usual. SOC team members courageously crossed the rushing water, using an extended ladder as a bridge, and prepared the driver to be transported safely. The tow truck driver was taken to Shock Trauma for treatment and was able to return home that very night.</p><p> This week, we held a special press conference to applaud the bravery and dedication of the first responders involved in last Friday’s rescue. Their heroic efforts helped save a life, and prevented the situation from becoming a tragedy. Take a moment to watch this story from WJZ-TV on their efforts, and join me in thanking our first responders.</p>","6/14/2013","Safer Streets, Rawlings-Blake Review","Safer Streets","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"7,000 Jobs","<p>Earlier this week, I introduced public infrastructure financing legislation to support Harbor Point, a new $1 billion master-planned, mixed-use community that will support thousands of construction jobs and permanent jobs and generate, on average, $19.6 million in new city tax revenue annually. Harbor Point is currently a largely-vacant 27-acre brownfields site—formerly the location of an Allied Signal chrome processing plant—located between the Fells Point and Harbor East communities.</p><p> Built in phases over 12 years, the project will include an estimated 1.6 million square feet of office space, new residential and retail space, a high-rise hotel, 1.2 million square feet of public parking (including 3,115 new spaces), and five distinct public urban parks. The project will be funded with approximately $920 million of private investment, supported by approximately $106.9 million of city Tax Increment Financing (TIF) bonds to finance public infrastructure, which does not presently exist at Harbor Point. In turn, the project is expected to create numerous benefits for Baltimore.</p><p> The project will bring significant new revenue to Baltimore City. Prior to the commencement of development at Harbor Point, the City has collected only about $244,000 per year in property tax revenue from the site. After development, the City anticipates an average of approximately $19.6 million per year in new tax revenues generated directly by the project. Harbor Point will sustain and grow the city’s tax base through increased property and other related taxes and revenues. The City will also receive profit sharing payments from the developer, subject to the approval of the Board of Estimates.</p><p> The development of Harbor Point will support a significant number of jobs, including an estimated 7,175 construction jobs, 6,611 direct permanent jobs, and 2,547 indirect jobs. The developer, working in conjunction with the Mayor’s Office of Minority and Women-Owned Business Development, is incorporating an inclusion strategy to comply with the City’s Minority and Women’s Business Enterprise program. The developer is also working closely with Baltimore Development Corporation and the Mayor’s Office of Employment Development to develop a local hiring plan to ensure that Baltimore City residents will have maximum opportunity to obtain employment related to the project under the mayor’s Employ Baltimore hiring program.</p><p> The project will include 9.5 acres of new public park land, including a half-mile of new public promenade connecting Fells Point with Harbor East—completing the city’s waterfront promenade system from Canton to Locust Point, and providing enhanced access to the city’s waterfront for all city residents.</p><p> The creation of a vibrant, new neighborhood will make Baltimore a better place to live, work, and play, furthering our goal of attracting 10,000 new families to the City of Baltimore. It is anticipated that the Harbor Point neighborhood will increase the city’s residential population by approximately 2,070 residents—a significant number of whom will be new to the city. In addition, the Harbor Point development project and the TIF will enhance and expand an existing public charter school, the Crossroads School, which will construct new educational facilities, partly as a result of TIF assistance.</p><p> Like the Inner Harbor revitalization effort of 30 years ago, the Harbor Point project represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to grow Baltimore by attracting new jobs, new residents, new tax revenue, and new public amenities. In total, more than a third of the development will be public park space that all of Baltimore’s residents can enjoy. I look forward to working with the City Council to move this important revitalization effort forward. I’m confident that we will be able to look back at this project together and know that it has made Baltimore better and stronger.</p><p> For more information about Harbor Point, including detailed financial figures and benefits for Baltimore, see our official press release.</p>","6/7/2013","Innovative Government, Growing Economy, Rawlings-Blake Review","Innovative Government, Growing Economy","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
"Creating Local Jobs","<p>This week, I joined representatives from CBAC Gaming, minority and local business leaders, members of the community, and my colleagues in government to break ground for the new Horseshoe Baltimore Casino. It was no small feat to get to this major milestone, and I am thrilled that this critically important project is moving forward.</p><p> On the heels of the worst recession since the Great Depression, when many families are still struggling to find job opportunities, this couldn’t have come at a better time. During construction, the project will support nearly 2,000 direct and indirect construction jobs and $119 million in wages and benefits. Once it’s open, Horseshoe is expected to generate 1,900 direct and indirect permanent jobs with wages and benefits totaling $72 million each year.</p><p> At my direction, the Mayor’s Office of Employment Development has already put in place a local hiring agreement with CBAC Gaming to ensure that more city residents are in line to benefit from job opportunities generated by the new casino. We have also created a new recruitment coordinator position to help identify qualified city residents to apply for positions at the facility.</p><p> The facility will not only be an economic engine in terms of new jobs and tax revenues, it will be an engine that will fuel millions of dollars in new development throughout the area. Building off the strength of Camden Yards, M&T Bank Stadium and downtown Baltimore’s great hotels and restaurants, the Horseshoe Baltimore Casino will transform the gateway into Downtown Baltimore. And funds from the casino—including table game revenues—will be used to help build new schools and recreation centers and to support community grants in South Baltimore and Park Heights.</p><p> Finally, the City’s income from the ground lease supports a 20 cent property tax reduction for city homeowners—a major step forward in our ongoing efforts to provide tax relief to attract and retain residents. Most importantly, Horseshoe has committed to the Employ Baltimore program and will make every effort to employ Baltimore City residents. Make no mistake—the economic impact of this project on the city is historic.</p><p> I am grateful to Caesars Entertainment and to the dozens of local partners who have committed their support to this project.</p>","5/31/2013","Growing Economy, Innovative Government, Rawlings-Blake Review","Growing Economy, Innovative Government","The Rawlings-Blake Review"
